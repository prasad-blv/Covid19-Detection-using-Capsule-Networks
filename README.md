# Covid19-Detection-using-Capsule-Networks
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the Coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause infection ranging from the common flu or cold to more severe disease that primarily affects the lungs and leads to death in the severe stage. Primary identification and isolating are the key to stop the spreading of this disease. Detecting COVID-19 disease is mainly carried out using methods like Coronavirus screening detection strips, COVID-19 antibody detection kits and CT scanning detection. However, in all these methods there exists the problem of low efficiency as these reports needed to be examined by a medical professional, which might not be possible at some times. To overcome this problem, convolution neural network model by using lung CT images is proposed which can classify covid and normal case. In this paper, we propose a capsule network model in which we use a two-dimensional relative self-attention mechanism to execute convolution. It can be utilized to increase COVID 19 case classification accuracy. The combination of traditional medical imaging diagnosis and deep learning technology helps medical personnel to make more rapid, accurate and effective diagnosis.
